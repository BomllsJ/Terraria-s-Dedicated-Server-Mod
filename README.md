Yet to clean up (Minor)
yet to removed un-needed for client purpose. (Major)

Developers
=============
TDSM is developed in c# so you will find it reasonably easy to manipulate. Also if ever have done Bukkit (Minecraft) Programming you should see some things are similar when programming a plugin.

On a side note, 
I would love for you to assist in the Development TDSM, you may fully well do so; It's why there is a GitHub :D
